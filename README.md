# Digital Life Innovations Team - Code Challenges

The DLI code challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the problem solving skills we expect you to use at BMW. It is part to of our recruiting process to evaluate your coding abilities.

We don't believe there is a one-size-fits-all technology solution. Solid development is about using the right tools for the job, and constantly learning about them. Use your README to discuss the experience you have with the technical stack you selected and we'll make note of that when reviewing your solution.

## Expectations
Read and follow the selected coding challenge carefully. Create a README.md containing your thoughts and decisions in a consise and clear way. You can either share your code via a Github link or ZIP file.

## Time Allotment
We respect your time and expect a result within one week. 

## Your Challenge README
Include the following items in your README:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices. Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.
* Commit History
* Use whatever development workflow works best for you. If your solution is small enough and a single commit is justified, that's fine; we just ask that you keep your commit history as coherent as possible.

## Evaluation Points
Your application will be reviewed and evaluated for the following characteristics:

* **Clarity**: Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
* **Correctness**: Does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code Quality**: Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
* **Testing**: If required - how thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change?
* **UX**: Is the interface understandable and pleasing to use?
* **Technical Choices**: Do choices of libraries, databases, architecture seem appropriate for the challenge?
