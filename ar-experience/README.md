# Coding Challenge

# Will it fit in my trunk? #

## Problem Description

Imagine you are shopping for new furniture (maybe at IKEA). However, you are not entirely sure whether the box or boxes you are interested in will actually fit in the trunk of your car.

## Challenge Overview

Implement a mobile augmented reality application projecting a virtual 3D blueprint of a car’s trunk into the environment. Create an interface that makes it easy for the user to estimate whether they can actually carry one or more real-world item(s) in the trunk of their car. The choice of platform and framework is up to you.

## Design Guidelines

Please follow these design guidelines:

- Your solution has to run on the latest mobile operating systems, i.e., either Android 10 or iOS 13
- The application should provide its users with a great, fluent, and seamless AR experience
- Your implementation should satisfy the respective platform's design guidelines

## Extensions

Implementing the barebone solution for this project can be trivially achieved, especially with the new frameworks provided by Apple and Google. Therefore, we would like to encourage the applicant to use his/her creativity and skills to implement functionalities to make this solution more useful and/or appealing. The applicant should feel free to come up with any number of functionalities. We try to help by providing some sugestions bellow:

### Design Improvements
* Create a 3D asset of the car itself
* Give the option of picking different car models
* Add sounds and animations
* Add the option of bending the back seats to increase trunk size
* Add different car models to choose from — for inspiration, we provide some models and their respective trunk sizes [here](model-sizes.md)

### Engineering Improvements
* Measure size or volume of the box
* Persist assets so they can be reloaded later
* Be able to create virtual assets in the world of the same size as the real life box
* Provide a counter stating how much of the trunk is still free
* Create a functionality that auto fit all the boxes in the trunk (in case you are using virtual boxes). Finding a way to use the minimum space possible.
* A simple way to solve occlusion problems

## Guidelines for Submission

Your submission shall contain the following:

- A README.md with a description of the problem and your solution.
- All source code. Package the source files into a zip archive or provide a link to a hosted repository for example on GitHub.
- Be well documented

## Evaluation Criteria

This assignment helps us to get insights into your style of programming, design and creativity. It is essential to write good quality and documented code that can easily be understood or extended by other developer, as well as bug free. We will also evaluate how appealing and useful is the experience.
